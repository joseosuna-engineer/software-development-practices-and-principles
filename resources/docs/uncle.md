## SOLID

* **S** - Single-responsiblity Principle

* **O** - The Open Closed Principle (OCP): A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

* **L** - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

* **I** - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.

* **D**  - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

## Package cohesion principles

* Release-Reuse Equivalency Principle (REP)

* Common Closure Principle (CCP)

* Common Reuse Principle (CRP)

## Package coupling principles

* Acyclic Dependency Principle (ADP)

* Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)

* Stable Abstractions Principle (SAP)
