* **The Open Closed Principle (OCP)**: A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

* **The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

* **The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

* **The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.
