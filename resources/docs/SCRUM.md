Scrum is a framework utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. 

**Scrum** is a feedback-driven empirical approach which is, like all empirical process control, underpinned by the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. 

All work within the **Scrum framework** should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br />

## Scrum values

1. **Commitment:** Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every sprint.
2. **Courage:** Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.
3. **Focus:** Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.
4. **Openness:** Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.
5. **Respect:** Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.
