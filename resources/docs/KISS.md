# Keep It Super Simple (KISS)

extracted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

**KISS**, an acronym for **keep it super simple**, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. 

The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson. The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.
