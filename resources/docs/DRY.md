# Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

extracted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

**Don't repeat yourself** (**DRY**, or sometimes **do not repeat yourself**) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They apply it quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation"
