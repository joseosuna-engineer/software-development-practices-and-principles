Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. American software engineer Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or "rediscovered" the technique, stated in 2003 that **TDD** encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.<br /> 

1. Add a test
  
2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
    
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
    
4. All tests should now pass
    
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved
    
Repeat
