# Software development practices and principles

## The Twelve Factors

The [twelve-factor](resources/docs/12factor.md) methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).

## SOLID

[SOLID](resources/docs/SOLID.md) is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## ACID

[ACID](resources/docs/ACID.md) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

## SCRUM

[SCRUM](resources/docs/SCRUM.md) is a framework utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.

## TDD

[Test-driven development (TDD)](resources/docs/TDD.md) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves).
