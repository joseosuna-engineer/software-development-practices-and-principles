# Software development practices and principles

## The Twelve Factors

The [twelve-factor](resources/docs/12factor.md) methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).

## Robert C. Martin's Design Principles and Design Patterns

Robert C. Martin collected [ten principles](resources/docs/uncle.md) dealing with object-oriented design. The first five of them—the so-called **SOLID** principles— deal with the design of classes.

## ACID

[ACID](resources/docs/ACID.md) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

## SCRUM

[SCRUM](resources/docs/SCRUM.md) is a framework utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.

## TDD

[Test-driven development (TDD)](resources/docs/TDD.md) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

## Git Commit Formatting Rules

Why good commit messages matter? If you browse the log of any random Git repository, you will probably find its commit messages are more or less a mess. A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves).

## DRY

[Don't repeat yourself (DRY)](resources/docs/DRY.md) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

## KISS

[KISS](resources/docs/KISS.md), an acronym for keep it super simple, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.

## The Law of Demeter

[The Law of Demeter](resources/docs/LOD.md) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.

## SCRUM values

[Scrum](resources/docs/SCRUM.md) is a framework utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

## XP Principles

The principles that form the basis of [XP](resources/docs/XP.md) are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. The principles are intended to be more concrete than the values and more easily translated to guidance in a practical situation.
